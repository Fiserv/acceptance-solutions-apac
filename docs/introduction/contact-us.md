# Introduction

The Developer Studio team will meet with you to better understand your situation. If using the Developer Studio makes sense for your team, we will begin the integration process. As part of this process, we will assign a developer contact to you which will help you each step of the way. Please contact our team lead Alvin Cho (info@fiserv.com) to setup the initial call and to begin the scoping process
