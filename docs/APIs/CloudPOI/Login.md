# Login

As part of the initial set-up, prior to integration, merchants would have received unique credentials as part of the set up process.
Login API authenticates merchantsâ€™ unique credentials, with a response that 

- Includes a session token
- Expiry time of the session token
- This token is mandatory in the header submitted for each API being triggered. 


## API Category: Mandatory

## How it works

1. Merchants need to initiates a Login request to fetch a session token before submitting any APIs to Fiserv backend system.
2. Each session token is active for a specific amount of time provided in ttl (time to live) field in the response message.
3. If the merchant tries to use the token beyond the expiry, Fiserv backend system will return with an error response.
4. The merchant will then need to initiate another login request to request for a fresh token, in order to submit any creation of new user request.
